### Aging Eye Classification
This is a series of 1D regression CNNs for sex/age based on Basset/Basenji architecture. These are mostly experimental, and have just been run on aging eye drosophila data. 
There are modules for preprocessing data. To run the core pipeline you can run preprocessing.ipynb. The model scripts can be run directly from inside the repo - currently 
two CNN models are supported, to an R^2 of ~0.7.
